## ℹ️ Overview

PetKit Client is a Python library for interacting with the PetKit API. It allows you to manage your PetKit devices, retrieve account data, and control devices through the API.

## 🚀 Features

- Login and session management
- Fetch account and device data
- Control PetKit devices (Feeder, Litter Box, BLE Water Fountain, Cloud Water Fountain, Purifiers)
- Fetch images & videos produced by devices
  > Pictures are available **with or without** Care+ subscription, Videos are only available **with** Care+ subscription

## ⬇️ Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install pypetkitapi
```

## 💡 Usage :

Here is a simple example of how to use the library to interact with the PetKit API \
This example is not an exhaustive list of all the features available in the library.

```python
import asyncio
import logging
import aiohttp
from pypetkitapi.client import PetKitClient
from pypetkitapi.command import DeviceCommand, FeederCommand, LBCommand, DeviceAction, LitterCommand

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        client = PetKitClient(
            username="username",  # Your PetKit account username or id
            password="password",  # Your PetKit account password
            region="FR",  # Your region or country code (e.g. FR, US,CN etc.)
            timezone="Europe/Paris",  # Your timezone(e.g. "Asia/Shanghai")
            session=session,
        )

        await client.get_devices_data()

        # Lists all devices and pet from account

        for key, value in client.petkit_entities.items():
            print(f"{key}: {type(value).__name__} - {value.name}")

        # Select a device
        device_id = key

        # Read or do an action ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### 📑 Reading devices informations :

```python
        print(client.petkit_entities[device_id])
```

### 📡 Available commands

Below is a reference of commands available via `send_api_request()` and `bluetooth_manager.send_ble_command()`

---
